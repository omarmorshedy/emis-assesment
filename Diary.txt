# Diary of development for Emis:

- Started by setting up the image for containerising code.
- Looked up Python docker images and copied one of them.
- Set up requirments files to use it to install the requirments in the image.
- I decided to use MYSQL as the database.
- Tried to do that then realised it'd be easier to start with a plain Ubuntu Image.
- Installed everything manually, including Pytho, MYSQL and other dependencies.
- Tried to deal directly with JSON fiels using Pandas. Didn't work quit well
- Looked up exactly FHIR standard which led to the FHIRY library.
- Tried to use the FHIRY library to deserialise JSON data into usable format.
- Didn't work in a format that would be usable.
- Did more research on how to fix that. [linked in article]
- Decided to switch from MYSQL to MongoDB.
